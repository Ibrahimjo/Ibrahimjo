## Who am I? :raising_hand_man:
As a highly skilled Flutter and Xamarin developer, I have a deep passion for creating cross-platform mobile applications that deliver exceptional user experiences. With several years of experience in the industry, I have developed a strong understanding of the mobile app development lifecycle and I possess the technical expertise required to deliver high-quality, scalable applications.

My expertise in Flutter includes a strong command of Dart programming language, widget development, Material Design, State Management, and more.

In addition, I have extensive experience working with Xamarin to develop cross-platform mobile applications for iOS and Android. I have a strong command of C# programming language and the .NET framework, as well as the Xamarin toolchain. I have developed several successful apps using Xamarin, ranging from small store management to big ecommerce apps.

I am a highly collaborative developer and enjoy working in agile teams. I am skilled at team work, mentoring junior developers, and collaborating with cross-functional teams. I have a passion for staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the mobile app development space, and enjoy sharing my knowledge with others.
